# Osu-Rate-Changer
<h2>Python command line program that changes the rate of an osu! map along with its audio.</h2>
<h3>If you don't see the new file ingame press F5 to refresh the maps.</h3>
<h4> Requires <a href="https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub/">pydub</a> ("pip install pydub" in command prompt if python is installed) and <a href="https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html">ffmpeg</a> in order to work.</h3>
<p>I made this in like 3 hours because I switched to linux and I couldn't get <a href="https://github.com/FunOrange/osu-trainer">osu trainer</a> to work</p>
